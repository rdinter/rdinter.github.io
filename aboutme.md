I am a PhD candidate in economics at [North Carolina State University](https://poole.ncsu.edu/gradecon/) and am currently on the job market. My fields of interest are regional economics, spatial econometrics, and rural/urban development. In my dissertation, I study topics related to the economic impact of broadband deployment as well as interregional migration with a focus on using spatial econometric techniques in addressing these topics. You can read more about these topics in the [Research](./research) section of this website.

The [Teaching](./teaching) section of this website is an online portfolio of my body of work as a teacher. There, you can find my teaching philosophy, an overview of my methods used in teaching, past courses taught as well as their associated course evaluations, and finally future courses and goals for myself.

As a little bit of background on myself, I grew up in Atlanta and attended undergrad at [Clemson University](http://economics.clemson.edu/) where I graduated with a Bachelor's of Arts in Economics & Philosophy. Outside of economics, I enjoy the finer points of barbecue, working out, and following the [Atlanta Hawks](http://www.nba.com/hawks) and [Clemson Tigers](http://clemsontigers.cstv.com/).
