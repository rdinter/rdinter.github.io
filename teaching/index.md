Rough template.

Teaching, which needs to be thought through a bit more. This should probably be a page which links to the courses and then a portfolio one. Each course should probably be divided up into its own folder as well ... which may then need to be its own project folder later on.

1. Portfolio.
2. Courses.
3. Other.

Let's revisit this.
