I have taught at NC State since enrolling in graduate school in Fall 2009. My first two semesters I was a lab instructor for EC 205 (Fundamentals of Economics) with three sections each semester. The following four semesters I instructed two independent sections of EC 202 (Principles of Macroeconomics) each semester. In the Fall of 2012 I taught one independent section for EC 202 and developed a new course for EC 495 that focused on Sports Economics. In all of my courses, I have used some form of moodle for the course. [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) is an open-source course management system that allows educators to create an effective online learning site. With moodle, I can update reading lists, upload documents, send announcements, and create online quizzes for the students.

Below are links to some materials used in each course as well as courses I am in the process of developing. Since the courses use moodle, they do not translate 100% to websites off of the moodle layout. Some course materials are password protected to ensure certain materials are only used by students who have taken the course. Please contact me if you would like access to the files.
