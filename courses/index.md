Rough template.

Teaching, which needs to be thought through a bit more. This should probably be a page which links to the courses and then a portfolio one. Each course should probably be divided up into its own folder as well ... which may then need to be its own project folder later on.

1. [Econometrics](metrics)
2. [Macroeconomics](macro)
3. [Spatial Statistics](spatial)
4. [Sports Economics](sports)

Let's revisit this.
